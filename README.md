# R-Project
This project shows the statistical analysis on the COVID dataset using R programming language.
In this project we have analyzed two claims:
1.The older people have died in majority due to COVID.
2.Men have died more than women due to COVID.

Using T-Test we have analyzed that the facts are statistically correct for the dataset.
